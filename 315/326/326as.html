    <h2>Assignment for 26 March 2015</h2>

    <p>
      This homework problem is to be done individually, not in pairs
      or other groups. It is due by noon Thursday, 26 March.
    </p>

    <ol class="separated">

      <li>
        Define a database table with three or four columns of your
        choosing.  For example, you might have lastName, firstName and
        emailAddress, and of course a primary key field.
      </li>

      <li>
        Write a PHP program or HTML page that presents the user with a form
        that allows them to enter data to store in the table. There
        may or may not be missing data, as appropriate for your
        specific columns. Use form controls to prevent errors as much
        as possible.
      </li>

      <li>
        Write a different PHP program that allows the user to request
        some (or all) of the data from the table and that presents it
        in some appropriate manner, in a way that makes sense.  You
        should present the results sorted in a useful way, and it
        would be especially nice if the user could choose how it was
        sorted.
      </li>

      <li>
        The SQL statement that creates your
        table should be in a file
        named <em>yourlastname</em><code>.sql</code>, where
        &ldquo;yourlastname&rdquo; is your last name in ALL LOWERCASE
        LETTERS. The file should be one that you have written directly
        with an editor, not one generated by a tool such as
        mysqldump. You may choose to pre-populate the table with some
        data to start with, in which case you should put SQL insert
        statements in this same .sql file.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make sure there is a .phps file for each of your .php
        files.
      </li>

    </ol>

    <p>
      By the due time and date, send an email message
      addressed to the homework dropbox 
      <a href="mailto:315@borax.truman.edu">315@borax.truman.edu</a>
      with a subject of &ldquo;326&rdquo; without the quotes.  The
      body of your email should contain the full public URL to the
      directory that contains the PHP and HTML files (make sure the
      directory is readable on the web). In addition, your email
      should have attached to it the .sql file that creates your
      database table.
    </p>
