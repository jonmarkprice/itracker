    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Self-Operating Napkin is activated when soup spoon (A) is 
      raised to mouth, pulling string (B) and thereby jerking ladle (C), 
      which throws cracker (D) past parrot (E). Parrot jumps after 
      cracker and perch (F) tilts, upsetting seeds (G) into pail (H). 
      Extra weight in pail pulls cord (I), which opens and lights 
      automatic cigar lighter (J), setting off skyrocket (K) which 
      causes sickle (L) to cut string (M) and allow pendulum with 
      attached napkin to swing back and forth, thereby wiping chin.
