    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      As you walk past cobbler shop, hook (A) strikes suspended boot (B), 
      causing it to kick football (C) through goal posts (D). 
      Football drops into basket (E) and string (F) tilts sprinkling can, (G) 
      causing water to soak coat tails (H). As coat shrinks, cord (I) opens 
      door (J) of cage, allowing bird (K) to walk out on perch (L) and grab 
      worm (M) which is attached to string (N). This pulls down window shade 
      (O) on which is written, &ldquo;YOU SAP, MAIL THAT LETTER&rdquo;. A 
      simple way to avoid all this trouble is to marry a wife who can't write.
