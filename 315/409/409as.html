    <h2>Assignment for 9 April 2015</h2>

    <p>
      This homework problem is to be done individually, not in pairs
      or other groups. It is due by noon Thursday, 9 April.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider the <a href="409/hangman.html">hangman
      game</a>. This is a modification of the game in your textbook at
      the end of chapter 8, mainly to make the JS unobtrusive and up
      to our standards. The game is fully functional, but is clunky to
      use. Modify the hangman page in the following ways:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Clear the old guess letter from the little text box beside the
        Guess button as soon as the guess is made, leaving the text box
        empty.
      </li>

      <li>
        After every guess, return the focus to the little text box
        beside the Guess button. But not at the beginning or end of the
        game when it would be more appropriate for the focus to be on
        a button.
      </li>

      <li>
        When the player loses, add a button to allow the player to see
        what the word was. Remove the button after use, and remove the
        word when play restarts.
      </li>

      <li>
        The word &ldquo;Guesses&rdquo; should appear only after the
        second guess has been made. After the first letter is guessed,
        the word should appear as &ldquo;Guess&rdquo;, and at the
        beginning of the game, before the first letter is guessed,
        there should be no word.
      </li>

      <li>
        Make all game play case insensitive, and make all guessed
        letters appear as lower case.
      </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      By the due time and date, send an email message
      addressed to the homework dropbox 
      <a href="mailto:315@borax.truman.edu">315@borax.truman.edu</a>
      with a subject of &ldquo;409&rdquo; without the quotes.  The
      body of your email should contain the full public URL to your
      hangman HTML file on a single plain line of text. Make sure your
      name appears in every file.
