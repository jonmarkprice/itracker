      <h1>QUALITY COFFEE, QUALITY CAFFEINE</h1>

      <p>
        At Starbuzz Coffee, we are dedicated to filling all your
        caffeine needs through our quality coffees and teas. Sure, we
        want you to have a great cup of coffee and a great coffee
        experience as well, but we&rsquo;re the only company that
        actively monitors and optimizes caffeine levels. So stop by
        and fill your cup, or order online with our new Bean Machine
        online order form, and get that quality Starbuzz coffee that
        you know will meet your caffeine standards.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, did we mention <em>caffeine</em>? We&rsquo;ve just
        started funding the guys doing all the wonderful research at
        the <a href="http://buzz.headfirstlabs.com" title="Read all
        about caffeine on the Buzz">Caffeine Buzz</a>.  If you want
        the latest on coffee and other caffeine products, stop by and
        pay them a visit.

        A woman, a plan, a coffee bean. Okay, that doesn&rsquo;t make
        a palindrome, but it resulted in a damn good cup of coffee.
        Starbuzz&rsquo;s CEO is that woman, and you already know her
        plan: a Starbuzz on every corner.
      </p>

      <p>
        In only a few years she has executed that plan and today you
        can enjoy Starbuzz just about anywhere.  And, of course, the
        big news this year is that Starbuzz teamed up with CS315
        students to create Starbuzz&rsquo;s Web presence, which is
        growing rapidly and helping to meet the caffeine needs of a
        whole new set of customers.
      </p>

      <p>
        We&rsquo;ve got a variety of caffeinated beverages to choose
        from at Starbuzz, including our House Blend, Mocha Cafe Latte,
        Cappuccino, and a favorite of our customers, Chai Tea.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also offer a variety of coffee beans, whole or ground, for
        you to take home with you.  Order your coffee today using our
        online Bean Machine, and take the Starbuzz Coffee experience
        home.
