    <h1>Self-Opening Umbrella</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Raindrops (A) fall on dried prune (B), causing it to swell and push 
      against stick (C) which forces iron hand (D) to rub wheel against flint 
      (E) in empty cigar-lighter(F). Flying sparks (G) ignite candle (H) which 
      starts water in kettle (I) boiling. Escaping steam (J) blows whistle (K).
      Circus monkey (L) thinks whistle is master's signal to start act and 
      jumps on trapeze (M) which swings and causes edge of knife (N) to sever 
      cord (O), releasing toy balloon (P). As balloon ascends attached string 
      (Q) opens door of cage releasing Ikklebirds (R) which fly in all 
      directions, causing strings to lift ends of umbrella. If you are hard up 
      and can't afford a new prune for each successive rain storm, stay in the 
      house and wait for the original prune to get old and wrinkled again.
